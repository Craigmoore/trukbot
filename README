trukbot

Simple, messy, probably badly made twitch.tv chatbot made in python.
Comes with three modules, TF2Lobby.py, Lastfm.py and links.py.
TF2Lobby module grabs lobby name and what map it is on, last.fm module grabs current playing song/song last played and links module grabs a page title if a url is posted in the chat.
 
Adding commands is done through the existing commands.json file and configuration is done with botcfg.cfg.
 
This is all released under the LGPL3 license.

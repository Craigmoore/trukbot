trukbot

Simple, messy, probably badly made twitch.tv chatbot made in python.
Comes with two modules, TF2Lobby.py and Lastfm.py.
TF2Lobby module grabs lobby name and what map it is on, and last.fm module grabs current playing song/song last played.

Adding commands is done through the existing commands.json file and configuration is done with botcfg.cfg.
